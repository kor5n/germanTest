# germanTest
App that I will use(or am using) for practicing german. I wrote this app in Unity because I didn't know how to make mobile applications with other programming languages. In the _GermantestPrototype_ folder I have my first prototypes that are wiritten with python with a framework called [kivy](kivy.org).
